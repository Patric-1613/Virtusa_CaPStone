# Contract fixture pack — draft, not the Milestone-0 deliverable

This is an expanded starter inventory (20 source items / 23 snapshots / 28 facts /
1 change set / 1 digest), built against the real
`docs/API_CONTRACT.md` shape so intelligence code has something
schema-valid to run against. It is **not** what `docs/TEAM_WORKFLOW.md`'s
"Day-one agreement" item 5 and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s Milestone 0
actually require:

## UUID v7 identifier convention (docs/adr/0007-uuid-v7-identifier-strategy.md)

Every id/foreign-key value in this pack is a real, frozen RFC 9562 UUID v7
value — generated once, offline, via the actual approved generator
(`uuid_utils.compat.uuid7(timestamp=<int epoch seconds>)`, the same
function `shared/ids.py::new_id()` calls in production), each with an
explicit timestamp plausibly matching that record's own narrative date
(e.g. a source item's id embeds a time close to its `first_fetched_at`).
Every value was self-validated (parsed, `.version == 7`, correct RFC 9562
variant bits) before being written in. This is deliberately **not** the
old memorable `a1000000-0000-4000-8000-...`-style placeholders with only
the version nibble flipped — those would freeze in values the real
generator never produced. Every cross-reference relationship the old
placeholders encoded (a source item's `latest_snapshot_id` equal to its
snapshot's `id`, a `Change`'s citations equal to real snapshot ids, etc.)
is preserved exactly, just with authentic values. These IDs are frozen
literals — never regenerated at test-run time — so the pack stays fully
deterministic.

> A committed, schema-validated fixture pack in `tests/fixtures/contracts/`:
> at least twenty `SourceItem` records with snapshots, two change sets,
> and two digests. It must include duplicate, changed-content,
> malformed-input, missing-evidence, and prompt-injection cases.

None of the edge cases (malformed input, missing evidence, a prompt-
injection string embedded in content) are represented here yet — that's
deliberately a joint exercise so ingestion, intelligence, and delivery
tests all validate against the same examples, per the Milestone-0
description. Replace these files wholesale when the team does that
session; don't just append to them solo.

## What this starter set demonstrates

- `Items 1-2` — same real-world event (GPT-4o's context window
  increase) covered by two different publishers, sharing `event_id`
  (the "same story, different outlet" case).
- `Item 3` — the prior state (GPT-4o's original 128k window at launch),
  giving `change_sets.json` a real previous/current pair to cite.
- `Item 4` — a sparse item (Anthropic/Claude) whose snapshot explicitly
  states its context window isn't published yet — `extracted_facts.json`'s
  5th entry records that as a real, grounded
  `disclosure_status: "not_disclosed"` fact (ADR 0006), backing
  `digests.json`'s second claim ("has not disclosed its context window")
  with actual evidence rather than an inferred absence.
- `Items 5–20` — 16 new source items expanding coverage across five major
  industry publishers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Mistral AI),
  diverse publishing dates across 2026, varied topic tags (`model_release`,
  `benchmark`, `research`, `api_update`), and multi-author records.
- `Items 5 & 6 (Pagination tie-breaker)` — Google DeepMind (`gemini-1-5-pro`)
  and Meta AI (`llama-3-1-405b`) share an identical `first_fetched_at`
  (`2026-08-21T10:00:00Z`) to exercise the keyset pagination `(first_fetched_at DESC, id DESC)`
  tie-breaking behavior when timestamps coincide.
- `Items 5, 6, 7 (Snapshot revision history)` — demonstrate multi-snapshot
  lineage: each item has two sequential snapshots (revisions 1 and 2), with
  `latest_snapshot_id` on the item pointing at revision 2.
- `Item 14 (Explicit non-disclosure)` — Anthropic Computer Use preview
  carries an explicit `disclosure_status: "not_disclosed"` fact with `value: null`
  for experimental token pricing, grounded by a literal quoted span.
- `change_sets.json` — one `ChangeSet` containing one `Change`, both
  `previous` and `current` citing real snapshot ids and source URLs. The
  `Change` carries `detected_at` — when the intelligence pipeline detected
  the change (ADR 0008 section 5.A), distinct from `current.observed_at`.
  The fixture value ends in `.500000Z` on purpose: it is evidence that the
  UTC/microsecond-preserving normalization keeps sub-second precision
  intact through the loader.
- `digests.json` — `digest_date` is a real calendar date on the wire
  (`YYYY-MM-DD`); the loader parses it to a `datetime.date` (ADR 0008
  section 5.B).
- `extracted_facts.json` — one or more `ExtractedFact` records per snapshot,
  all using `extraction_method: "llm_structured_output"` with `quoted_span`,
  `confidence`, `extraction_model`, and `prompt_version` recorded per the
  contract's reproducibility requirement (ADR 0004). Disclosed facts record
  valid string values; non-disclosed facts record `value: null` with
  `disclosure_status: "not_disclosed"` (ADR 0006).
