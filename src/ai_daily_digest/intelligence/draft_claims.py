"""Deterministic claim drafting — the "Draft digest claims" step for
mechanical, single-field changes. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: "Prefer
deterministic code for URL normalization, hashing, dates, numeric
comparison, citation validation, and deduplication. Use an LLM ... only
where deterministic rules are insufficient." A field going from one value
to another is exactly the case deterministic code should own; free-form
prose comparisons across *different* subjects are a separate, model-
backed step (not built yet — see docs/LLM_AGENT_SPECS.md).
