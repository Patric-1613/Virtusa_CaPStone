"""Shared evidence-grounding primitives, used by every place in
intelligence/ that has to answer "is this specific value actually backed
by this specific piece of text" — extract_facts.py (value vs. quoted
span), compare_subjects.py (claim prose vs. the fact-table rows it's
allowed to cite), and validate.py (claim text vs. cited snapshot
content).

Deliberately narrow and deterministic, per docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's
"prefer deterministic code" rule: this is NOT a semantic entailment or
contradiction checker (that would need an LLM, and isn't built). What it
does check, precisely: does every *number* asserted in some text also
appear in some reference text, using formatting-tolerant, word/digit-
boundary-safe matching. That's a real, meaningful check for this
project's fields (context_window_tokens, prices, benchmark_scores are
all numeric) but it is a floor, not a ceiling — a claim could still be
numerically grounded and prose-wise wrong in some other way (e.g. it
could swap which subject a real, cited number belongs to, if nothing
else catches that first). Callers layer this on top of their own
subject/field/citation-ownership checks, not instead of them.

# never an asserted number, regardless of where within the token it
# falls -- matched and excluded as a WHOLE SPAN in numbers_in() below,
# rather than via a boundary lookaround anchored to each individual digit
# run's own position.
#
# That span-based approach replaces an earlier lookbehind-only fix
# (`(?<![A-Za-z]-)`) that excluded a match from STARTING at "4" in
# "GPT-4.5", but couldn't stop the regex engine from then retrying and
# matching "5" on its own -- nothing about "5", looked at from its own
# position, is adjacent to a letter or a hyphen. Python's `re` module
# only supports fixed-width lookbehind, so there's no way to ask "does
# some letter-hyphen sequence appear an arbitrary distance back from
# here" from inside a single number-matching regex; matching the whole
# name+version token as its own span sidesteps that limitation entirely
# instead of chasing further boundary special cases.
#
# Deliberately requires the LETTERS to come first, before the hyphen: a
# number followed by a hyphenated word ("256,000-token context window")
# is a real, legitimate, already-tested number and must not match this
# pattern -- digits, not letters, precede its hyphen.
