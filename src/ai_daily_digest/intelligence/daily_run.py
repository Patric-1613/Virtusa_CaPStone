    its own validation status -- it can still be part of a "review"
    digest, same as any other unsupported claim, but never nudge a
    digest into "published" on its own. Mirrors validate.py's own rule
    that a check can only ever veto a publish, never grant one.

    Pre-ADR-0005, this existed because compare_subjects()'s numeric
    grounding check only caught a claim stating a specific WRONG number
    -- it did nothing for a qualitative/relational claim like "OpenAI is
    cheaper than Anthropic" (no number to check at all), or a claim that
    swapped which number belonged to which subject (both numbers real,
    just attributed backwards).

    ADR 0005's structured `ComparisonAssertion` + deterministic rendering
    (compare_subjects.py) closes both of those fabrication classes at the
    root: the model can no longer author a value, a relation, or any
    prose at all, so a swapped or invented comparison can no longer reach
    a claim's text in the first place. That does NOT retire this
    function. ADR 0005 explicitly keeps comparison auto-publish disabled
    regardless -- deterministic rendering removes the specific failure
    modes this policy was originally written for, but comparison output
    has not yet been proven correct in practice at scale, and relaxing
    this guardrail is a deliberate, separate decision for a future review
    step, not an automatic consequence of this refactor. Every

    per item, sharing one compiled graph and one `store`), then a single
    cross-subject comparison pass over whichever subjects the batch
    actually touched, then assembles everything into one Digest.

    `store`, `known_snapshot_ids`, and `snapshot_resolver` are all
    mutated / owned across calls the same way — the caller threads the
    same objects into tomorrow's run so history, citation validity, and
    resolvable snapshot content all carry over. `snapshot_resolver` is
    REQUIRED and caller-supplied, deliberately not built internally here:
    a resolver's usefulness comes entirely from what it can resolve
    beyond just this batch (e.g. a real ingestion-store-backed resolver
    spanning many days), so run_daily() must never quietly construct its
    own batch-scoped one and discard the caller's broader view. Pass
    `InMemorySnapshotResolver()` for a batch-scoped resolver equivalent
    to this function's old internal behavior. Each processed item is
    registered into it via `.add()` when the resolver supports that (see
    `_process_item()`) — a resolver Protocol only guarantees
    `get_content()`, so a resolver with no `.add()` (e.g. one backed
    entirely by ingestion's own storage) is left to manage its own
    contents.

    An item that fails to resolve (even after the LLM fallback) is
    recorded in `unresolved_item_ids`, not silently dropped. An item
    whose processing *raises* (a transient model failure, a malformed
    response that exhausts `call_structured`'s retry, ...) is recorded in
    `failed_item_ids` and the rest of the batch still runs — one item's
    failure must not cost every other item's already-computed claims for
    the day, the same principle ingestion applies to its own sources.

    Every Change produced by the batch is also grouped into ChangeSet
    aggregates (see change_sets.py) and returned on the result. Each
    Change's `change_set_id` is allocated lazily and batch-scoped (ADR
    0007's "Batch-scoped ChangeSet ID allocation"): `acc` (below) owns
    the allocator, threaded into `build_graph()` so its `compare` node
    can request one per subject on first use within this run only.

    digest_date accepts either a real `date` or an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`
    string (normalized to `date` once here, at the boundary, before
    reaching assemble_digest()/Digest -- ADR 0008 section 5.B, see
    _normalize_digest_date()). An unparseable or non-`YYYY-MM-DD`
    string raises `ValidationError` -- the same strictness Digest's own
    field validation applies, not stdlib `date.fromisoformat`'s more
    lenient parsing. A `datetime` is rejected outright with `TypeError`,
    not silently accepted or silently truncated.

    batch_detected_at (ADR 0008 section 5.A): the single timezone-aware
    detection time stamped onto every Change this run produces --
    supplied by the caller for a reproducible/testable run, or computed
    once here as `datetime.now(UTC)` when omitted (the only place in the
    whole pipeline `datetime.now()` is called; every node downstream
    receives the already-resolved value, never calling it themselves). A
    naive `batch_detected_at` is rejected outright, not silently
    reinterpreted as system-local time.

    compare_subjects()) may cause the digest to auto-publish, regardless
    of its own validation status -- see _never_auto_publish_comparisons().
