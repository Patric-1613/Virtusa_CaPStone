"""Cross-subject comparison — ADR 0005 (docs/adr/0005-structured-
comparison-and-snapshot-resolution.md). The LLM proposes structured
`(subject_a, subject_b, field)` triples to compare; code looks up the
real stored values, applies the field's `ComparisonRule`
(shared/attributes.py), and renders the claim text deterministically —
the same pattern draft_claims.py already uses for single-subject
changes. The model never authors comparison prose or numbers at all.

This closes two fabrication classes a free-text-plus-numeric-check
design could not, no matter how many checks got bolted onto it:
  - A claim asserting no number at all ("OpenAI is cheaper") has nothing
    for a numeric check to verify, true or false.
  - A claim can state two real numbers attributed to the WRONG subject
    (swapped) — a check confirming both numbers appear *somewhere* among
    real values can't detect a swap. Deterministic rendering makes this
    class structurally impossible: code alone decides which number goes
    with which subject.

ADR 0005 point 2: only fields with a registered `ComparisonRule`
(`shared/attributes.py::COMPARISON_RULES`) are eligible for comparison
at all — Phase 1 added `context_window_tokens`, Phase 2 added
`input_price_usd`/`output_price_usd`. Every other field
(benchmark_scores, availability_regions, licence_terms, modalities) is
still excluded until its own representation is designed — a deliberate
scope limit, not a bug.

ADR 0006 (docs/adr/0006-disclosure-status-semantics.md): a row with
nothing ever recorded ("unknown") and a row with a real, grounded
non-disclosure statement ("not_disclosed") are different claims, not the
same "no value" case — see `FactRow`'s own docstring. Both still abstain
from comparison here (neither has a real value), but `_resolve_assertion`
surfaces which one it was in its rejection reason.
