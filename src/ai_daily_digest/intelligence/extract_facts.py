"""Fact extraction — the "Extract typed facts with citations" step in
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's intelligence workflow diagram. Turns one
DocumentSnapshot's text into zero or more ExtractedFact records against
the closed field list (shared/attributes.py). See
docs/LLM_AGENT_SPECS.md#extract_facts for the full contract.

Six guardrails enforced in code, not just requested in the prompt:
  1. quoted_span must actually appear in the snapshot text (grounding
     check) -- a model that paraphrases instead of quoting produces a
     fact that gets silently dropped, not silently stored. Applies
     regardless of disclosure_status -- an explicit non-disclosure
     statement needs a real citation exactly the same as a value does
     (ADR 0006).
  2. for a DISCLOSED candidate, value must actually be supported by
     quoted_span itself -- a real, grounded quote can still have an
     invented value attached to it (e.g. quoting a real sentence but
     reporting a different number than it states); check #1 alone can't
     catch that, see grounding.py. For a NOT_DISCLOSED candidate, quote
     existence (#1) alone is not semantic support either -- see #6 below,
     _quote_supports_non_disclosure's own real check for this case.
  3. field must be in the closed list -- an invented field is dropped.
  4. a quote shared across two different fields' candidates in the SAME
     extraction response is ambiguous evidence -- e.g. "Input costs 5
     and output costs 15" doesn't prove which number is input_price_usd
     and which is output_price_usd. Per review: this is CONTAINMENT, not
     a complete attribution fix -- see _cross_contaminated_indices'
     own docstring for its documented limits (it can't catch a mix-up
     when the sibling fact is omitted entirely, and can false-positive
     on coincidental shared digits). The real fix needs character-offset
     citations, not a re-quoted substring -- see
     docs/DESIGN_PROPOSAL_comparison_and_grounding.md point (e), not yet
     built. Until then, BOTH candidates sharing ambiguous evidence are
     dropped rather than guessing which one is right.
  5. disclosure_status="not_disclosed" and a real value are mutually
     exclusive, and disclosure_status="disclosed" (the default) requires
     a real value -- enforced at the model level on both FactCandidate
     here and ExtractedFact itself (shared/schemas.py), per ADR 0006, so
     a malformed candidate is rejected before it ever reaches the checks
     above, not silently coerced into one state or the other. `value`
     has no default on either model -- a candidate/fact that omits it
     entirely is rejected too, never silently treated as one state or
     the other.
  6. a NOT_DISCLOSED candidate's quote must actually SUPPORT a
     non-disclosure claim about THAT field, not merely exist in the text
     -- see _quote_supports_non_disclosure's own docstring: no real
     number anywhere in the quote; the SAME CLAUSE (split on sentence
     punctuation AND compound-sentence joins -- a comma+conjunction, a
     bare contrast conjunction, or a dash, not just a period) must carry
     both an approved withholding phrase and a concept pattern matching
     the candidate's own field; and that clause must not ALSO name a
     different field's concept family -- e.g. neither "The model
     features a large context window. Pricing details have not been
     released." (two sentences) nor "Benchmark scores are strong and
     pricing has not been announced" (one compound clause naming two
     unrelated concepts) may support a non-disclosure claim for the
     field whose concept happens to appear first. WITHIN the pricing
     family specifically, an input/output qualifier must also match the
     candidate's own price field -- "Output pricing has not been
     announced" must not support input_price_usd just because the two
     price fields share one family (see
     _pricing_qualifiers_support_field). Per review: quote existence
     alone conflates "this text is real" with "this text means what the
     candidate claims it means" -- the same gap check #2 already closes
     for a disclosed value's number, now closed for a non-disclosure
     claim too.

The accepted quoted_span and confidence are kept on the resulting
ExtractedFact (not discarded) so the evidence a fact was built from can
still be audited later, not just at extraction time -- see
docs/adr/0004-extracted-fact-keeps-evidence.md.

    specific field is being withheld". Mirrors what
    grounding.py::value_supported_by_quote() does for a disclosed
    value's number -- a real, grounded quote can still be attached to
    the wrong claim.

    1. The quote must not contain a real number anywhere -- a quote that
       states an actual value ("$5 per million tokens") is a disclosed
       fact mislabeled not_disclosed, not a genuine non-disclosure;
       reject rather than guess which label is right.
    2. At least one CLAUSE of the quote (split on sentence punctuation
       AND compound-sentence joins -- see _CLAUSE_SPLIT_RE's own comment
       for why a period alone isn't enough) must contain an approved
       explicit-withholding phrase (_WITHHOLDING_PHRASE_RE), AND that
       same clause's set of matching concept FAMILIES
       (_FAMILY_CONCEPT_PATTERNS) must be EXACTLY the candidate's own
       family -- not a superset, not a different one, not empty.
       Checking the field concept against the whole quote independently
       of the withholding phrase (rather than the same clause) would
       accept e.g. "The model features a large context window. Pricing
       details have not been released." for context_window_tokens -- the
       withholding phrase and the field concept are both present
       SOMEWHERE in the quote, but not about the same fact; that must be

       family (not just "contains the candidate's own") is what rejects
       e.g. "Benchmark scores are strong and pricing has not been
       announced" for benchmark_scores -- that clause's own concept
       AND a withholding phrase are both present, but the SAME clause
       ALSO names pricing, so which fact is actually being withheld is
       ambiguous; it must not count as support for either. A field with
       no registered family fails closed too. Same-family siblings
       (input_price_usd/output_price_usd) never trigger this against
       each other -- they map to the one "pricing" family, so a clause
       naming both still has a matching-family set of exactly
       `{"pricing"}`.
    3. WITHIN the pricing family specifically, a clause that names the
       WRONG price field is still rejected --
       _pricing_qualifiers_support_field's own docstring for the exact
